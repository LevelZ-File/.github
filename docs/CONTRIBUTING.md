# Contributing
Contributing guidelines for the project. We appreciate your help in helping us to improve the project.

## Pull Requeset Process
1.) Ensure that the pull request is at the correct branch you want to merge in.

2.) Ensure that your new code has been tested and works properly. For example, if you're contributing to bindings, make sure tests pass against all official examples.

3.) Confirm that the code is ready to be merged along with any documentation you intend to include.

We will approve and merge your pull request as soon as possible if these requirements are met.
